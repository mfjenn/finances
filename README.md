# Finances - DRAFT WORK IN PROGRESS

Bridge Foundry, along with all of the Bridges, is one whole organization dedicated to doing whatever it takes so that the makers of technology are reflective of our society, because diversity fosters innovation. We empower people with technology through teaching and facilitating access, enlarging the community of people who give back and teach others.

Bridge Foundry operates as a program of the [School Factory](http://schoolfactory.org), which is a 501c3 organization (giving us non-profit status in the USA).

The Bridge Foundry work of collecting, tracking, distributing and reporting funds for all Bridges in a tax responsible way is made possible thanks to a paid part-time Bridge Foundry employee. School Factory manages our federal reporting and other administrative overhead such as reimbursements and expense tracking.

We straongly believe the way Bridge Foundry, as well as each of the Bridges and their affiliated Chapters manage their funds must be a process that is 100% transparent. Here is where you will find information about all of our financials and money management processes.

## Funding policies and status
Each Bridge and each Bridge Chapter maintains full autonomy over the funds they raise (more detail on [Bridge & Chapter Policies](funding/bridge-chapter-policies.md).)

The up-to-date financial information for Bridge Foundry and each Bridge entity can be found at [funding status](funding/status.md).

## For volunteers
This section contains links to information about establishing, tracking, and using funds that you raise as your own Bridge organization or your own Bridge Chapter using Bridge Foundry's resources. Alternatively, you can learn about applying for a grant from Bridge Foundry.

- Different ways Bridge Foundry funds are used to [financially support](financial-support) individual Bridges and Chapters initiatives, as well as single workshops

## Sponsorship

- How a volunteer can [request an invoice](/sponsorship/request-invoice.md) for a sponsor
